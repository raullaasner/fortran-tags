;; Quick explanation:
;;  fortran-read-tags    works like visit-tags-table
;;  fortran-find-tag     works like find-tag
;;  fortran-pop-tag-mark works like pop-tag-mark
;;  fortran-goto-next    works like find-tag for multiple matches
;;  fortran-find-proc-calls finds all the places where the procedure
;;                          has been used
;; See README for detailed information.

;; Global variables:
;;   fortran-buffers:
;;     Each invocation of goto-new-position pushes the current buffer
;;     into fortran-buffers from where it is popped by
;;     fortran-pop-tag-mark.
;;   fortran-positions:
;;     Similar to fortran-buffers except contains the saved positions.
;;   alt-positions:
;;     Holds the positions of alternative definitions if any were
;;     found by fortran-find-tag or contains the matches found by
;;     fortran-find-proc-calls. This is a list where each item is a
;;     3-item list (filepath, line_nr, position).
;;   alt-positions-counter:
;;     Remembers how many times alt-positions has been accessed. Each
;;     call to fortran-goto-next moves on to the next element of
;;     alt-positions.
;;   fortran-tags-path:
;;     Absolute path to the tags file.
;;   fortran-tags-version-ok:
;;     True if the current version and the version found on the first
;;     line of the tags file agree.
;;   cur-scope:
;;     The scope at the position of the cursor as determined by
;;     fortran-find-scope.
